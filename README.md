# Python OOP Deep Dive

This repository is a hands-on deep dive into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. It covers not only the fundamentals but also the internal workings of OOP features such as `__dunder__` methods, inheritance, MRO, and abstract base classes â€” tailored for **data science interviews**.

## Topics Covered

- Classes and Objects
- Constructors & `self`
- Encapsulation & Properties
- Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Multilevel)
- Polymorphism & Duck Typing
- Method Overriding & `super()`
- Dunder Methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.)
- Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Classmethod vs Staticmethod
- Abstract Classes using `abc` module
- Interview-style Implementation Questions

## Objective

- To gain a deep understanding of OOP in Python.
- Build a structured, professional GitHub profile.
- Prepare for real-world coding interviews.
